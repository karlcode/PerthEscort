          <h1>Greetings my lovely,

Thank you for making your way to my site. As our society has evolved into a more

egalitarian and a less judgemental one women have been afforded opportunities to

explore dimensions that heretofore had been generally open only to men. It has

become far more acceptable for a woman to wish to spend time with a quality

gentleman without the complications of a commitment or a relationship. If you are

such a woman then I encourage you to peruse this site.

My name is Josh Chase, and I am a professional companion. I am the perfect

solution to your dilemma.

Welcome to my website - please have a look around and get to know me better, and

if you feel we would be compatible, I would be delighted to hear from you.</h1>
